This is our submission for our C220 Game Technology Fall 2019 Game Jam. 

The theme for our Game Jam was "The End of The World", and we decided to make a text adventure because we had three creatives on our team and we wanted to make a fun narrative based game where we could shine and show our collective creativity! 

For each path, there are good endings and bad endings. We decided to punish players who make the "wrong" decisions by giving the, bad ends that usually end up with them dying because of not picking up the correct item. In turn, we reward players who take the right paths and give them second lives (med kit) and good endings. 

Given more time and help, we would like to make a link between our assets and our code, however, we weren't able to do this in the time we were given. Please feel free to take a look through our assets folder and listen to our soundtrack and look at our backgrounds! We would also like to create more paths and more twists and more endings.
